# Pointcloud Experiments with ModelNet40. Includes PointNet and GAPNet

The purpose of this repository is to provide a clean implementation of GAPNet. In order to facilitate comparability, it includes PointNet as a baseline. The goal is to come up with a readable implementation of GAPNet that outperforms PointNet.

## Networks.

### 1. PointNet.

Reference: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)

PointNet is included as a baseline.

### 2. GAPNet.

Reference: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08705](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08705)

GAPNet combines the Graph Neural Network approach with attention.
